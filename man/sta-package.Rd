\title{Statistical Trend Analysis (STA) for Time Series of Satellite Imagery}
\description{
STA applies the Mann-Kendall test for trend to the so-called \emph{shape parameters} 
of periodic time series. STA estimates shape parameters via harmonic regression.
STA can handle \code{numeric} time series and \code{RasterStack} of satellite images.
}
\details{
Shape parameters is the term used in vegetation monitoring to refer to the amplitudes
and phase angles resulting from fitting a harmonic regression model to time series of 
vegetation indices derived from satellite images. Regardless of its origin, STA can be
applied to any periodic time series which makes this package potentially useful to
other disciplines such as hydrology, climatology and econometrics.



With \code{\link{sta}} (the main function of this package) it is possible to perform
the Mann-Kendall test for trend on time series of the three most commonly used 
shape parameters: \emph{mean}, \emph{annual} and \emph{semiannual}. These parameters
are the estimated amplitude coefficients of the aforementioned harmonic regresion
model. This function allows parallel processing to handle large satellite time series
imagery.

STA includes the following graphical methods:
\itemize{
   \item \code{\link{plot.staNumeric}}: generic plot displaying \code{\link{sta}}'s output
   for numeric time series.
   
   \item \code{\link{plot.staMatrix}}: maps of \code{\link[mapview]{mapview-class}} displaying
   \code{\link{sta}}'s output for \code{RasterStack}.
}

STA include the following datasets:
\itemize{
    \item \code{\link{marismas}}: numeric vector containing 10-day Composite NDMI values
    from 2000 to 2018.
    
    \item \code{\link{ndmi}}: \code{RasterStack} containing 612 spatial subsets of 10-day
    Composite NDMI images acquired from 2001 to 2017.
